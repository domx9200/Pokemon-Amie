# PokemonAmie

A plugin for Pokemon Essentials to add in the Pokemon Amie minigame from X and Y.

# No Complete Build

As it stands right this moment, the code isn't complete. I have only really just started on updating the plugin to v19, it will also be updated to v20 once I am done with the v19 version. That being said, below is a list of the features that will be included in the final version. The original script from v18 was written by **Bhagya Jyoti and Pizza Sun** while also using the sprite mask and easy mouse system scripts from **Luka SJ**.

In my version, I will be using most of the original spritework, and will be continuing to use the sprite mask and easy mouse system scripts. A large amount of the original code is being overhauled, to try and reduce the total clutter for better maintainability in the future. anyways, the features are as follows:

- Addition of the amie stats on all pokemon, even works on save files that didn't have it prior
- Addition of all of the amie abilities related to when a pokemon has a high affection for you. such as the additional avoid chance, the crit chance, and the status shakeoff.
  - In terms of what I already have completed, I have managed to get the XP bonus done (although silent), the status removal chance, and the extra avoidance chance.
- Various ways to add affection, such as feeding your pokemon various items like berries or fresh water or petting them
  - I have already implemented the affection raising through using items in the bag, as a silent additional bonus to using them.
- An Amie menu much like the 3ds versions, which uses the mouse to control, allows you to feed your pokemon, pet your pokemon, and so on. I don't have any plans to implement minigames for the time being.
  - primarily, the menu code will be a dirivative of the original code written by **Bhagya Jyoti and Pizza Sun**, as it worked well in their version, and while I will need to modify the mouse code (because **Luka SJ** changed how it worked in v19), most of the code will be close to the original, if not a little bit more spread out.
